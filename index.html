      <section class="card" id="html-section">
        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <h3>The 3 types of CSS</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Inline: used to style a specific, single element directly in the HTML file. </li>
          <li>Internal:used to style an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element (meta code)</li>
          <li>External: uses a seperate, linked file (linked in the HTML file's head) and is the most common/preferred method</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Terms and Commands</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Margin: space outside of an element, not visable on the page. Increasing value adds a buffer, 0 value indicates NO extra space around the element</li>
          <li>Padding: space inside the element. Increasing value makes the entire element bigger.</li>
          <li>* symbol: used to apply a rule to ALL the elements visible on the page</li>
          <li>Link External CSS: in the head section of HTML file, after the final META but before the TITLE</li>
          <li>Rel: specifies the relationship between current doc (ie the HTML file) and the linked doc (ie external CSS stylesheet)</li>
          <li>Href: specifies the location (URL) of the external, linked resource  and always starts with ./ (ie ./assets/style.css)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Concepts and Framework</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS Box Model: every HTML element is a box. Each boxed element is surrounded by another box element, as shown below</li>
          <img src="./assets/CSSBoxModel.png" alt="Box Model diagram.">
          <li>DRY Code: Do Not Repeat Yourself encourages reusing/shairng code to reduce # of lines that need to be written or maintained. Keeps code as simple and small as possible</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <h3>Commands</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to working on it</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch you're currently working on</li>
          <li>git add -A: stages changes to be committed</li>
          <li>git commit -m "name/details of commit": commits changes</li>
          <li>git pull/git pull (branch name): pulls from Github repo</li>
          <li>git push/git push (branch name): pushes commits to Github repo</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <h3>Terms and Commands</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Var: declares a variable, is followed by the unique variable name that can be referenced</li>
          <li>= symbol: assignment operator, assigns specific data to the command</li>
          <li>Array: a single variable that is used to hold a group of (usually related) data. Can store multiple items with different data types in a single variable</li>
          <li>String: must be enclosed in quotation marks</li>
          <li>Index: unique number (starting at 0) used to identify individual data items and their location inside an array</li>
          <li>For Loop: uses the predictable pattern of an index to perform a task on all the items in an array by executing a single code block again and again. Contains the 3 following statements: </li>
          <ul>
            <li>Starting Point: [var x = 0] declare a variable (x) and give it a value (0, to start in the begining becasue the firxt index of an array is always 0) </li>
            <li>Condition: As long as the number in the variable (x) is less than the length of the array the loop will keep running. Use the built-in LENGTH property to express</li>
            <li>Repetition: [x++] to allow the code to loop over each item in the array</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Function: [function NAME () {CODE BLOCK}] set of instructions that do NOT automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run and must be called by name to execute</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Concepts and Framework</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Control Flow: the order that code is executing in a script
